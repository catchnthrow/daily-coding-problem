# daily-coding-problem

https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/  sends an email with a problem every day.
This repo is created to provide solutions of those problems in C#

IMPORTANT: The solution may or may not have issues as these are tested against a smaller set of test cases. Anyone who wants to contribute to testing these solutions please contact.

## Below are the problems whose code is available:

### Problem 485: Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
Example: given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb"

### Problem 487: Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.
Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram 4 and 6 are cousins.
####   1

####  23

#### 456

### Problem 489: Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.
For example, given the array [5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1], return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is [5, 2, 3, 4, 1].
