# daily-coding-problem

https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/  sends an email with a problem every day.
This repo is created to provide solutions of those problems in C#

IMPORTANT: The solution may or may not have issues as these are tested against a smaller set of test cases. Anyone who wants to contribute to testing these solutions please contact.

## Below are the problems whose code is available:

# Problem 485: Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
Example: given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb"

# Problem 487: Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.
Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram 4 and 6 are cousins.
###   1

###  23

### 456
